# gender_detector
# Description:
The aim of this project is to develop an gender predictor using deep learning techniques. This system will be able to automatically predict the gender of an individual in a given image or video stream. The accurate prediction of age and gender can have significant applications in various domains such as targeted advertising, human-computer interaction, surveillance, and demographic analysis.
# Usage
Gender prediction with EfficientNet classification
Here is the dataset link that I used to train this model:

Here is the model link (if somehow it doesn't work on colab) that I trained using EfficientNET:

Download the model file and run the inference_gender file to test this model on local environment.

If you want to run this on Google Colab. Just simply run the GenderDetection.ipynb file.
This is a simple demo:
